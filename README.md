## 📖 Project Overview

The **Hospital Patient Record Management System** is a comprehensive terminal-based application developed in **C++** that simulates the day-to-day operations of a hospital.

The system enables efficient management of patients, doctors, appointments, hospital admissions, billing, and medical records while demonstrating the practical implementation of major **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

Instead of simply storing records, the application provides a structured workflow similar to a real hospital management system where doctors, patients, appointments, and billing are interconnected.
